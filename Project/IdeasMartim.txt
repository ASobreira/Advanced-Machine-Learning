From moodle:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The project proposal should address a problem:
- for which there is a plenty of data, with a significant amount of attributes
- where machine learning techniques studied in this course can be applied

A general suggestion:
- choose a problem that is meaningful for you, either professionally or not

Some possibilities:
- A comparison of different techniques applied to the problem (for instance reproducing work of a scientific article)
- An application of a technique to a problem where this technique was not used before and comparison to published results with other models
- An exploration of different configurations of a technique in one or more problems

The proposal document should is limited to 1,000 words, in pdf.
A couple of slides may be prepared to present the proposal in class.  Presentation duration: max 5mins

The best data set for this would be the improved on and simplified version of
KDD-CUP99 called NSL-KDD. (there is more info on this at the links above)

and dataset links are in it alongside other versions of the dataset that 
could be easier/lead to better results):
